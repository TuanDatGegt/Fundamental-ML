- The submission deadline is strict: **11:59 PM** on **June 22nd, 2024**. Commits pushed after this deadline will not be considered.

## üì¶ Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **/data**: This directory contains the facial expression dataset. You'll need to download the dataset and place it here before running the notebooks. (Download link provided below)
- **/notebooks**: This directory contains the Jupyter notebook ```EDA.ipynb```. This notebook guides you through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and classification tasks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

This project is designed to be completed in the following steps:

1. **Fork the Project**: Click on the ```Fork``` button on the top right corner of this repository, this will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account. Complete the table at the top by entering your team member names.

2. **Download the Dataset**: Download the facial expression dataset from the following [link](https://mega.nz/file/foM2wDaa#GPGyspdUB2WV-fATL-ZvYj3i4FqgbVKyct413gxg3rE) and place it in the **/data** directory:

3. **Complete the Tasks**: Open the ```notebooks/EDA.ipynb``` notebook in your Jupyter Notebook environment. The notebook is designed to guide you through various tasks, including:
    
    1. Prerequisite
    2. Principle Component Analysis
    3. Image Classification
    4. Evaluating Classification Performance 

    Make sure to run all the code cells in the ```EDA.ipynb``` notebook and ensure they produce output before committing and pushing your changes.

5. **About the project**: The data consists of grayscale images of faces, each measuring 48x48 pixels. The faces have been automatically aligned to be roughly centered and occupy a similar area within each image. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion expressed, assigning it to one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). The dataset contains a total of 35,887 examples. This project aims to classify facial expressions from pixel images by applying machine learning models. The goal is to develop a system that can accurately recognize and classify expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and fear.
6. **System requirements**:
   1. Python 3.12.3
   2. Library: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, pyplot, sklearn, tensorflow
7. **NoteBook Contents**:
   1. PCA Data
   2. Setup model: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine), MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
   3. Comparing model performance on original data and PCA data
